# 1. Introduction
Find the town of Bude in Western England. This is a town that is well-known as a beach resort. You're going to make two maps of Bude ?C a road map and a watercolor map.

On both maps, mark the map with vacation spots you might like: surfing beaches and the cricket grounds (one of the most stunning the the country and very local). Pick two local beaches (this will require some googling).

Finally find a pub that is convenient to the cricket grounds. Mark the route from the grounds to the pub.



# 2. Recommanded Places
## 1. Cricket ground: Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club
  Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club is situated on the clifftops overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and is quite simply one of the most stunning locations you could ever wish to visit, let alone play cricket at! 
  Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club was founded in 1870. Over the years it has played host to Hockey matches, Tennis, Cricket and even used for Mortar practice in WW2!

## 2. Crooklets_Beach
  A wide expanse of golden sand is exposed at low tide, bordered by rocky outcrops ideal for rock-pooling. Crooklets is at the north side of Bude and can be reached by a short walk over the Summerleaze Down or down the hill from the town centre.
  Crooklets is very popular with surfers and is home to the Bude Surf Life Saving Club.  The beach has great facilities including a large car park, level access and viewing area, a play area, skate park, beach cafe, showers, amusements and pubs close by.  
  There are various beach huts available for daily hire, from just ??10 - ??20 per day.  Please call the Tourist Information Centre on 01288 354240 to book.
  Please note: Dogs are welcome on this beach except between Easter Sunday and 30 September when a seasonal dog ban is in place.

## 3. Summerleaze Beach
  Summerleaze has a unique appeal, not least because it is less than five minutes?? walk from the centre of Bude and the large car park leads directly to the sand dunes. The river, with its bobbing fishing boats, flanks the wide, sandy beach that is sheltered by the impressive breakwater, making the beach particularly popular with families and surfers. Beach Huts are bookable daily or weekly from ??10 - ??20 per day. Contact the Bude Tourist Information Centre on 01288 354240
